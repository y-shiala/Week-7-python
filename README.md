# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project performs a complete analysis of the Iris dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and robust error handling.

---

## 📦 Features

- Loads data from the built-in Iris dataset 
- Handles missing values by filling with column means
- Displays basic statistics and data structure
- Groups and summarizes data by category
- Creates 4 types of visualizations:
  - Line chart (trend over time)
  - Bar chart (comparison by species)
  - Histogram (distribution)
  - Scatter plot (relationships)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Install required packages:
